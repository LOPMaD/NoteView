### README
This is my first program in C++. 
I created a console application that allows you to open a text file and view its content. 
I also implemented a cursor-like feature, which enables you to navigate the file using the arrow keys or the mouse wheel.

First and foremost, I made this project to practice C++ and learn different libraries. 
Specifically, I used <ncurses.h> to display the file's content in the console. To store the lines from the file, I used <vector>. 
I also created a structure for the variables used in the functions, particularly in viewing(), so that when the values of the variables change in one function, they can be saved for later use.
